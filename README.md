Wallaby-Firmware
=======

This project provides firmware for the Wallaby 2016 Botball Robot Controller.

This is the STM32 code used on the Wallaby.

It is no longer under development (but is mostly stable). 

It has been built using Crossworks... Currently no way to build using standard build/make utilities.

Note: The Wallaby controller is now outdated/obsolete. The next controller is the KIPR Wombat. The firmware for that can be found at https://github.com/kipr/Wombat-Firmware
